# Neighborhood Trip Planning App - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview of Implementation Strategy

I've broken down this complex project into iterative steps that build on each other, ensuring testable progress at each stage. This approach allows for:

- Early validation of core functionality
- Test-driven development
- Incremental complexity
- Proper integration between components

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure

#### Prompt 1: Initial Project Structure

```
Create the initial project structure for a neighborhood trip planning app with TypeScript. Set up:
1. A React frontend with TypeScript
2. A Node.js Express backend with TypeScript
3. Configure ESLint and Prettier for both frontend and backend
4. Set up basic folder structures for both projects
5. Create a README.md with project overview and setup instructions
6. Initialize Git with appropriate .gitignore files

The project should follow the specifications from the SPEC.md file, supporting Hebrew (RTL) content and preparing for PostgreSQL integration. Don't implement any features yet, just create the basic scaffolding.
```

#### Prompt 2: Database Setup

```
Set up the PostgreSQL database schema for our neighborhood trip planning app. Create:

1. A database migration system using knex.js or similar
2. Initial migration files for the core entities:
   - Family (including adults and children)
   - Trip
   - GearItem
   - User (for authentication)
   - Logs
   - Relationship tables (trip_admins, trip_attendance)
3. Database connection configuration with environment variables
4. Test database setup for automated testing

Include appropriate foreign keys and constraints. Write the schema based on the entity relationships described in section 5 of the SPEC.md.
```

## Implementation Notes

- Each prompt builds on the previous ones, ensuring a cohesive development process
- Testing is integrated at each stage to ensure reliability
- The Hebrew/RTL requirements are addressed throughout the frontend development
- Security and role-based access control are implemented early and enforced consistently
- The system follows the entity relationships defined in the specification
- WhatsApp integration focuses on message generation without requiring actual WhatsApp API access
- The development follows a logical progression: infrastructure → auth → core entities → advanced features

This approach ensures that the development process is manageable, testable, and results in a fully functional application that meets all the requirements in the specification.
