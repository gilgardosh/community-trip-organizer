# Admin Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive admin-specific backend functionality that has been implemented following the role capabilities outlined in section 4 of SPEC.md.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Admin Service (`src/services/admin.service.ts`)
A comprehensive service layer providing all admin operations:

#### User Management
- `updateUserRole()` - Update user roles (SUPER_ADMIN only)
- `getAllUsers()` - Fetch all users with filtering by role/type
- `getUserActivityLogs()` - Get activity logs for specific users

#### Family Management
- `getPendingFamilies()` - Get families awaiting approval
- `bulkApproveFamilies()` - Approve multiple families at once
- `bulkDeactivateFamilies()` - Deactivate multiple families at once

#### System Metrics & Reporting
- `getDashboardMetrics()` - Comprehensive system-wide metrics
  - Trip stats (total, draft, published, upcoming, ongoing, past)
  - Family stats (total, pending, approved, active, inactive)
  - User stats (total, adults, children, admins)
  - Attendance statistics
- `getSystemSummary()` - Quick overview for dashboard
- `getTripStats()` - Detailed trip statistics with filtering
- `getFamilyStats()` - Detailed family statistics with filtering
- `getTripAttendanceReport()` - Comprehensive attendance report per trip

#### Activity Logs
- `getActivityLogs()` - Fetch all logs with comprehensive filtering
  - Filter by user, action type, entity type, entity ID, date range
  - Support for pagination (limit/offset)
- `getEntityActivityLogs()` - Get logs for specific entities

#### Data Export
- `exportData()` - Export system data to JSON
  - Configurable data inclusion (users, families, trips, logs, attendance, gear)
  - Date range filtering
  - Complete data export with relationships

### 2. Admin Controller (`src/controllers/admin.controller.ts`)
RESTful API endpoints with proper validation and error handling:

#### User Management Endpoints
- `POST /api/admin/users/:userId/role` - Update user role

- `POST /api/admin/trips/:tripId/unpublish` - Unpublish trip
- `POST /api/admin/trips/:tripId/admins` - Assign admins to trip
- `POST /api/admin/trips/:tripId/admins/:adminId` - Add admin to trip

#### Statistics & Reporting Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/metrics` - Dashboard metrics
- `GET /api/admin/summary` - System summary
- `GET /api/admin/stats/trips` - Trip statistics

#### Activity Logs Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/logs` - All activity logs
- `GET /api/admin/logs/:entityType/:entityId` - Entity-specific logs

#### Data Export Endpoints
- `POST /api/admin/export` - Export system data

### 3. Admin Routes (`src/routes/admin.ts`)
Comprehensive routing with proper access control:

#### Access Control Levels
- **SUPER_ADMIN only**: User management, family approval/deletion, trip publishing, admin assignment, logs, data export
- **SUPER_ADMIN and TRIP_ADMIN**: Statistics and reporting endpoints
- **All routes**: Require authentication via `protect` middleware

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/admin.test.ts`)
45 passing tests covering:

## Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Permissions
Following SPEC.md Section 4:

#### SUPER_ADMIN Capabilities
- âœ… Approve trips and trip admins
- âœ… Approve families
- âœ… Delete/deactivate families
- âœ… View all trips and families
- âœ… Manage user roles
- âœ… Access all system logs
- âœ… Export system data
- âœ… Publish/unpublish trips
- âœ… Assign trip admins

#### TRIP_ADMIN Capabilities
- âœ… View statistics and reports (limited to their managed trips)
- âœ… Access dashboard metrics

#### FAMILY Capabilities
- ðŸš« No admin endpoint access (403 Forbidden)

### Logging & Audit Trail
All admin actions are logged:
- User role changes
- Family approvals/deactivations
- Trip publications
- Admin assignments
- Data exports
- All logged with user ID, action type, entity details, and changes

## Integration

### Route Registration
Admin routes registered in main router (`src/routes/index.ts`):
```typescript
router.use('/admin', adminRouter);
```

### Service Integration
Admin service integrates with existing services:
- `familyService` - For family operations
- `tripService` - For trip operations
- `logService` - For activity logging

## Data Export Features

### Exportable Data
- Users (with family relationships)
- Families (with members)
- Trips (with admins, gear, schedules)
- Attendance records
- Gear items and assignments
- Activity logs

### Export Filters
- Date range filtering
- Selective data inclusion
- Relationship preservation

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- Efficient Prisma queries with proper includes
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Selective data loading
- Proper indexing via database schema

### Metrics & Monitoring
- Comprehensive system metrics
- Real-time statistics
- Attendance analytics
- User activity tracking

## Error Handling

### Validation
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Prisma schema constraints

### Error Responses
- 400: Bad Request (validation errors)
- 401: Unauthorized (not authenticated)
- 403: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Server errors

## Testing Results
âœ… **45/45 tests passing**
- Full endpoint coverage
- Access control validation
- Error handling verification
- Data integrity checks

## API Documentation Example
